# Sensors
This part focuses on sensors, namely temperature and light. The first project uses a NTC to create a voltage divider which lights LEDs based on the temperature. The second one uses a phototransistor that acts like a switch to create a light/movement sensor. Here you can find the schematics and prototypes.
